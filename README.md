  **No spatial ID strategy**:

  **Spatial ID Strategy 1**: 1. Identify Water sources/types around the sites manually, 2. Calculate the theoretical hydrogeological flow of groundwater around the sites (direction and 
  extent), 3.  Construct a spatial weight matrix of neighboring postal codes based on 1. and 2. (Alternativly, skip 1. and 2. initially and use a Contiguity.), 4. include a spatial error 
 term in the   spatial model for other missing control variables at the postal code level

  **Spatial ID Strategy 2**: 1. Identify the amout of commuters around each prod. sites and it's extend and direction for constructing spatial weight matrices.

  **Other Strategy**:

  **Initial Model Spec.:**
   - Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), if goal is unbiased betas of non-spatial parameters.,
   - SAC: Main goal testing a spatial theory (diffusion/channel) whilst controlling for other 
  spatial deps.,
   - Spatial Error Durbin Model (SDEM) (if other unobservable spatial-effects).
